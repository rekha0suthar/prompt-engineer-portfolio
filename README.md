# Machine Learning Portfolio

## Indroduction
  As an aspiring and experienced Machine Learning Engineer, wanted to build a personal Machine Learning portfolio to share learnings, and experiences and collaborate with people who have the same interest in this field.

## Projects

## Deep Learning
### Face Detector or Face Recognition
>**Keywords:** numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pathlib, PIL(Image, ImageDraw) and face_recognition *[View Source](https://github.com/rekha0suthar/machine-learning-portfolio/tree/main/face_detector)*

In this project, I have used the **face_recognition** library. With the help of this library, I get face location, face embeddings, and many more features from Image. This project can detect faces in images, draw rectangles, or lines over facial features(nose, eyebrows, lips, etc.) and do some digital makeup. At the end we are giving input image and the model is giving a similar face from training data.

### Image Classification - Cat-Dog Classifier
>**Keywords:** fastai, gradio *[View Source](https://github.com/rekha0suthar/deep-learning-projects/tree/main/cat-dog-classifier)*

I have built this model with the help of **fastai**  library and built User Interface using Gradio. We give input image of a dog or cat and the model gives output with either it is cat or dog with percentage. In UI, we can upload an image and the output will be shown on the right side. I have deployed this model on Hugging Face.
